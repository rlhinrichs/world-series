<br>Write a program that reads the file P22-HW6-Input.txt containing the names of all the baseball teams who have won the World Series. The program should create a dictionary in which the keys are the names of the teams, and each key’s associated value is the number of times the team has won the World Series. The program should also create a dictionary in which the keys are the years, and each key’s associated value is the name of the team that won that year. The program should prompt the user for a year in the range of 1903 through 2021. It should then display the name of the team that won the World Series that year, and the number of times that team has won the World Series.
